 COVID-19 CDS Mutator

COVID-19 pandemic is a very harsh situation for everyone in the world. So, analyzing the origin and evolutionary path of this virus may help us to predict future mutations and probably develope medicines.
We know that two of the most important evolutionary pressures are "Codon usage comptability" and "Maximum content of CpG". In this script we try to understand the proportion of these factors using heuristic "Genetic Algorithm" and simulation of natural mutations in the environment.
